#Creating Forms Application
Angularjs 1.6.9 version is used and supperted by bootstrap.

##Note:
This applications needs an server because of "CORS" error. When The application is made work on "file:///..." link, this causes the "CORS" error. My solution is, to make it run on the server like localhost with "http://...". The WAMP server has already been used and running. So WAMP server is my recommendation but it is up to you.
